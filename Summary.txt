==================== Cucumber ==============================

1. Feature File (3)

2. Step definition

3. Before/After:

Hooks file:
	1. Hooks are blocks of code that run before or after each 	scenario or each step in a scenario
	2. The location of hooks file should be under Step Definition 	package only
	3. It will be called before and after Each Scenario.

4. Runner file:

In Cucumber, while you write your tests in Gherkin (feature files), you need a way to execute these tests. This is where a JUnit runner file comes in. It's a standard Java class annotated with @RunWith(Cucumber.class) from the Cucumber-JUnit integration library.

features - path to feature file
	glue     - package name
	tags     - Grouping   (also we have to mention before scenario)
	dryrun   - false
	plugin   - html/json - Reporting

5. Better Report:
We need plug in pom.xml

6. Grouping:
@tags in the feature file before scenario and the same we can mention in runner file with tags keyword.

7. Background Keyword:

	The Background keyword is used to define a set of steps that 	are executed before each scenario within a feature file.

	It's a way to set up preconditions or initial state that is 	common to multiple scenarios in that feature.

8. Assertions

9. Passing parameter from feature file to steps
10. Data Driven Testing (Scenario Outline)
11. Data Tables
